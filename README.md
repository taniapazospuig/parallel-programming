## Introduction to Parallel and Distributed Programming - Universitat Pompeu Fabra

This repository contains my group deliverables for the **Introduction to Parallel and Distributed Programming** course, a second-year subject in the Bachelor's degree on *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. The deliverables in this repository correspond to the **2024 edition** of the course.

### About the Course

- **Theory Instructors**: Ricard Borrell and Pablo Arias  
- **Lab Instructors**: Sergi Laut Turon, Pavel Pratyush, and Daniel Santos-Olivan  
- **Institution**: Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona  

### Project Details

This repository contains the practice deliverables developed with my partner **Júlia López**. For each lab, we were provided with a C framework as a starting point, and we implemented the code in C according to the exercise requirements, applying parallelization techniques with **OpenMP**, **MPI**, **OpenACC**, and **CUDA**. Each lab includes an in-depth analysis of the computation time for our parallelized code, documented in a report to examine the effects and performance gains of various parallelization techniques.
